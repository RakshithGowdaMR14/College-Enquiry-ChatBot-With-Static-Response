# College-Enquiry-ChatBot-With-Static-Response
College Enquiry ChatBot With Static Responses is a simple, efficient chatbot designed to assist users with common college-related queries. Unlike AI-powered chatbots that generate dynamic responses, this chatbot uses static responses pulled from a predefined knowledge base. When a user asks a question, the chatbot matches the input against known queries and returns the most relevant answer from its database.

📚 Predefined Knowledge Base: All responses are drawn from a structured set of question-answer pairs.

💬 Instant Responses: Returns quick, relevant answers to known queries.

🏫 College-specific Information: Focuses on common questions like admission process, fee structure, courses offered, contact details, and more.

📱 User-friendly Interface: Simple frontend for users to interact with the chatbot.
