# College-Enquiry-ChatBot-With-Static-Response
College Enquiry ChatBot With Static Responses is a simple, efficient chatbot designed to assist users with common college-related queries. Unlike AI-powered chatbots that generate dynamic responses, this chatbot uses static responses pulled from a predefined knowledge base. When a user asks a question, the chatbot matches the input against known queries and returns the most relevant answer from its database.

✅ Features

🔍 Keyword-based Matching: Identifies user intent using keyword or phrase matching.

📚 Predefined Knowledge Base: All responses are drawn from a structured set of question-answer pairs.

💬 Instant Responses: Returns quick, relevant answers to known queries.

🏫 College-specific Information: Focuses on common questions like admission process, fee structure, courses offered, contact details, and more.

📱 User-friendly Interface: Simple frontend for users to interact with the chatbot.


🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Flask(for web interface)

JSON or text files (for knowledge base)

HTML/CSS (for UI)

📌 Limitations

* Can only respond to queries present in the knowledge base.

* No support for NLP or context-aware conversations.

* Requires manual updates to the knowledge base for new queries.
